# 4combinator

A read-only interface for selected 4chan boards, featuring a Hacker News-inspired UI designed for a work-safe browsing experience.

## About

4combinator provides a simplified way to browse 4chan content with a clean, minimalist interface that looks like Hacker News. No account is required, and users cannot post or interact with the content - it's purely for reading purposes.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma (for caching)
- **API**: tRPC for type-safe API calls
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Hosting**: Vercel

## Disclaimer

This is a personal project created for educational purposes. All content is fetched from 4chan's API and temporarily cached to avoid rate limiting. This is an unofficial client and is not affiliated with 4chan in any way.
